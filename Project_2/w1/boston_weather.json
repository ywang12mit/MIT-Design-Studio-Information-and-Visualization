Moderate impacts are likely for the Saturday night high tide and then lingering minor impacts for the Sunday afternoon high tide. * COASTAL FLOOD IMPACTS...Major coastal flooding is expected in much of the warning area tonight with severe damage to vulnerable shoreline structures likely. Moderate to major coastal flooding is expected for the Saturday midday high tide. Some vulnerable homes along the immediate shoreline may be destroyed from the combination of high water and severe wave action tonight. There will be widespread inundation of coastal roads and basements with life-threatening inundation depths above 3 feet in some locations for both tonight`s and Saturday`s high tides, especially where wave overwash is involved. Many neighborhoods will remain cut off for an extended time. This will remain a very dangerous storm. * SHORELINE IMPACTS...Very severe to extreme erosion will occur and may compromise protective dunes, seawalls, and other structures. && Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour. Category thresholds are based on still water levels. Impacts may be greater, depending upon wave action.
